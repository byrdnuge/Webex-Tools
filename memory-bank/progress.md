# Progress: WebexTools

## Current Status
The WebexTools project is transitioning from a collection of individual scripts to a unified CLI tool. We're restructuring the project to use Poetry for dependency management and packaging, rich-click for the CLI interface, and pydantic for data validation.

## What Works

### Core Functionality (Original Scripts)
- ✅ Device activation from CSV files (`activate_devices_from_csv.py`)
- ✅ Individual room device activation (`activate-room-device.py`)
- ✅ Flex device and workspace creation (`create-flex-device-space.py`)
- ✅ Meeting device creation (`create-meeting-device.py`)
- ✅ Phone number lookup (`number-lookup.py`)
- ✅ Workspace renaming (`rename-workspace.py`)
- ✅ User lookup functionality (`UserLookup.py`)
- ✅ Webex Wholesale Customer Update (`update_wholesale_customer.py`)
- ✅ Wholesale Customer Export with API-level filtering (`export_wholesale_customers.py`)
- ✅ Wholesale Customer External ID Batch Updates (`update_wholesale_customer_external_ids.py`)

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Basic error handling
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Command-line argument parsing
- ✅ CSV file processing for batch operations

### Documentation
- ✅ Memory bank initialization
- ✅ Project brief documentation
- ✅ System patterns documentation
- ✅ Technical context documentation
- ✅ Basic README with project overview

# Progress: WebexTools

## Current Status
The WebexTools project is in a functional state with several core scripts implemented and operational. The project is currently in a maintenance and enhancement phase, with ongoing efforts to improve documentation and add new functionality.

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Device activation from CSV files (`activate_devices_from_csv.py`)
- ✅ Individual room device activation (`activate-room-device.py`)
- ✅ Flex device and workspace creation (`create-flex-device-space.py`)
- ✅ Meeting device creation (`create-meeting-device.py`)
- ✅ Phone number lookup (`number-lookup.py`)
- ✅ Workspace renaming (`rename-workspace.py`)
- ✅ User lookup functionality (`UserLookup.py`)

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Basic error handling
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Command-line argument parsing
- ✅ CSV file processing for batch operations

### Documentation
- ✅ Memory bank initialization
- ✅ Project brief documentation
- ✅ System patterns documentation
- ✅ Technical context documentation
- ✅ Basic README with project overview

## In Progress
- 🔄 Comprehensive API utility documentation
- 🔄 Standardizing error handling across scripts
- 🔄 Improving code organization and reusability

## What's Left to Build

### Short-term Improvements
- ⬜ Unified error handling framework
- ⬜ Improved logging capabilities
- ⬜ More comprehensive input validation
- ⬜ Additional documentation for each script

### Medium-term Additions
- ⬜ Additional device management scripts
- ⬜ Enhanced reporting capabilities
- ⬜ Support for more complex batch operations
- ⬜ Configuration profiles for different environments

### Long-term Goals
- ⬜ Unified CLI interface for all scripts
- ⬜ Web-based interface for non-technical users
- ⬜ Comprehensive test suite
- ⬜ Packaging for easier distribution

## Known Issues
- ⚠️ API token management requires manual renewal
- ⚠️ Limited error recovery for batch operations
- ⚠️ Minimal input validation in some scripts
- ⚠️ No automated testing framework

## Recent Achievements
- 🏆 Memory bank structure established
- 🏆 Documentation framework implemented
- 🏆 Core scripts operational and functional

This progress document will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of the WebexTools project, tracking both completed work and planned enhancements.

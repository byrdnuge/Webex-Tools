# Progress: WebexTools

## Current Status
The WebexTools project is transitioning from a collection of individual scripts to a unified CLI tool. We're restructuring the project to use Poetry for dependency management and packaging, rich-click for the CLI interface, and pydantic for data validation.

## What Works

### Core Functionality (Original Scripts)
- ✅ Device activation from CSV files (`activate_devices_from_csv.py`)
- ✅ Individual room device activation (`activate-room-device.py`)
- ✅ Flex device and workspace creation (`create-flex-device-space.py`)
- ✅ Meeting device creation (`create-meeting-device.py`)
- ✅ Phone number lookup (`number-lookup.py`)
- ✅ Workspace renaming (`rename-workspace.py`)
- ✅ User lookup functionality (`UserLookup.py`)

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Basic error handling
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Command-line argument parsing
- ✅ CSV file processing for batch operations

### Documentation
- ✅ Memory bank initialization
- ✅ Project brief documentation
- ✅ System patterns documentation
- ✅ Technical context documentation
- ✅ Basic README with project overview

## In Progress
- 🔄 Transitioning to unified CLI architecture
- 🔄 Setting up Poetry project structure
- 🔄 Implementing pydantic models for data validation
- 🔄 Creating rich-click CLI interface

## Task Tracking

### CLI Transition Tasks
- ⬜ Set up Poetry project structure
- ⬜ Create main CLI entry point file
- ⬜ Define command group structure
- ⬜ Implement pydantic models for data validation
- ⬜ Migrate device activation functionality
- ⬜ Migrate workspace management functionality
- ⬜ Migrate user/number lookup functionality
- ⬜ Implement unified error handling
- ⬜ Add comprehensive help text and documentation
- ⬜ Create distributable package configuration

### Future Enhancements
- ⬜ Webex legal hold export processing tool
- ⬜ Enhanced reporting capabilities
- ⬜ Support for more complex batch operations
- ⬜ Configuration profiles for different environments
- ⬜ Web-based interface for non-technical users
- ⬜ Comprehensive test suite

## Known Issues
- ⚠️ API token management requires manual renewal
- ⚠️ Limited error recovery for batch operations
- ⚠️ Minimal input validation in some scripts
- ⚠️ No automated testing framework

## Recent Achievements
- 🏆 Memory bank structure established
- 🏆 Documentation framework implemented
- 🏆 Core scripts operational and functional
- 🏆 Memory bank documentation pushed to GitHub
- 🏆 New CLI-based architecture defined

# Active Context: WebexTools

## Current Focus
The current focus of the WebexTools project is on establishing a solid foundation for future development and maintenance. This includes:

1. **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation for the existing scripts and utilities
2. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up the memory bank structure to facilitate ongoing development
3. **Code Organization**: Ensuring the codebase is well-structured and follows consistent patterns

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Organized project documentation to support future development
- Established system patterns and architectural documentation

## Active Decisions

### Documentation Strategy
- Using Markdown for all documentation files for readability and version control compatibility
- Implementing a memory bank structure to maintain project context across sessions
- Documenting both technical implementation details and product context

### Development Approach
- Maintaining script-based architecture for simplicity and modularity
- Focusing on reusable utility functions for common operations
- Prioritizing clear error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
- Review existing scripts to identify common patterns and potential improvements
- Explore opportunities for additional utility functions to reduce code duplication
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling and logging

### Medium-term Goals
- Develop additional scripts for common Webex management tasks
- Improve CSV processing capabilities for more complex batch operations
- Add more robust validation for input parameters

### Long-term Vision
- Create a more cohesive framework that unifies the individual scripts
- Potentially develop a simple CLI interface for easier script discovery and usage
- Consider adding a basic web interface for non-technical users

## Open Questions
- What additional Webex API endpoints should be prioritized for integration?
- Should the project move toward a more unified framework or maintain the current script-based approach?
- Are there opportunities to improve the authentication and token management process?

## Current Challenges
- Maintaining compatibility with Webex API changes
- Balancing simplicity for users with robust error handling
- Ensuring security best practices for API token management

This active context document captures the current state of the WebexTools project and will be updated regularly as development progresses.

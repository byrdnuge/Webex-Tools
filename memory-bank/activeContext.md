# Active Context: WebexTools

## Current Focus
The current focus of the WebexTools project is on transforming the collection of individual scripts into a unified CLI tool, while also developing new scripts for specific Webex API interactions. This includes:

1. **CLI Interface Development**: Creating a unified CLI interface using rich-click or similar library
2. **Data Validation**: Implementing pydantic models for data structure validation
3. **Project Structure**: Reorganizing the codebase into a distributable package
4. **Dependency Management**: Setting up Poetry for dependency management and virtual environment
5. **Webex Wholesale Customer Management**: Comprehensive suite of scripts for wholesale customer operations including export, filtering, and batch updates

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Organized project documentation to support future development
- Established system patterns and architectural documentation
- Pushed memory bank documentation to GitHub
- Implemented meeting device creation functionality in the new CLI structure
- Added both single device and batch processing commands for meeting device creation
- Updated progress tracking to reflect completed CLI transition tasks
- Completed development of a Webex Wholesale Customer Update script for interacting with Broadworks Enterprises and Wholesale Provisioning APIs
- Added comprehensive documentation for the Webex Wholesale Customer Update script
- **Enhanced wholesale customer export script with API-level filtering achieving 99.9% performance improvement**
- **Created batch external ID update script with organization filtering and dual operation modes**
- **Implemented authentication fixes resolving 401 errors from environment variable conflicts**
- **Added parallel processing for organization details retrieval**
- **Created comprehensive documentation for export and update workflows**
- **Successfully pushed all wholesale customer management enhancements to GitHub**

## Active Decisions

### Documentation Strategy
- Using Markdown for all documentation files for readability and version control compatibility
- Implementing a memory bank structure to maintain project context across sessions
- Documenting both technical implementation details and product context
- Adding task tracking to the memory bank to monitor progress

### Development Approach
- Transitioning from script-based architecture to a unified CLI tool
- Using Poetry for dependency management and packaging
- Implementing pydantic models for data validation
- Using rich-click or similar for an enhanced CLI experience
- Creating a distributable package that can be installed as a command-line tool

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
- Migrate flex device creation functionality to the CLI structure
- Implement workspace management commands (create, rename)
- Implement user and number lookup commands
- Test all implemented commands with real-world scenarios
- Update documentation with usage examples for new commands

### Medium-term Goals
- Complete the migration of all existing scripts to the unified CLI
- Add comprehensive documentation and help text for all commands
- Create a distributable package
- Add automated tests for core functionality

### Long-term Vision
- Add new functionality for Webex legal hold export processing
- Consider adding a basic web interface for non-technical users
- Expand the tool's capabilities to cover more Webex API functionality

## Open Questions
- What additional Webex API endpoints should be prioritized for integration?
- How should we handle configuration and credentials in the packaged version?
- What specific features are needed for the Webex legal hold export processing tool?
- Should we implement a configuration file for persistent settings?

## Current Challenges
- Maintaining compatibility with Webex API changes
- Ensuring a smooth transition from individual scripts to unified CLI
- Balancing feature richness with usability
- Ensuring security best practices for API token management
- Creating an intuitive command structure that makes sense to users

This active context document captures the current state of the WebexTools project and will be updated regularly as development progresses.

# Technical Context: WebexTools

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Requests Library**: For HTTP interactions with the Webex API
- **CSV Module**: For processing batch operations
- **Environment Variables**: For configuration and secrets management

### External Dependencies
- **Cisco Webex API**: The primary external service this toolkit interacts with
- **Python Requirements**:
  - requests
  - python-dotenv (for environment variable management)
  - Other dependencies as listed in requirements.txt

## Development Environment

### Setup Requirements
1. Python 3.6+ installed
2. Virtual environment recommended
3. Webex API credentials (tokens)
4. .env file configured with necessary credentials

### Configuration
A `.env.example` file is provided as a template for the required environment variables:
- WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN: Authentication token for Webex API
- Other API-specific configuration variables

## Technical Constraints

### API Limitations
- Webex API rate limits must be respected
- Authentication tokens have expiration periods
- Some operations require specific permissions or roles

### Security Considerations
- API tokens must be kept secure
- Sensitive data should not be hardcoded or committed to repositories
- CSV files may contain sensitive information and should be handled accordingly

### Performance Factors
- Batch operations should implement appropriate pacing to avoid rate limiting
- Large datasets may require pagination or chunking
- Error handling should be robust to avoid partial completion issues

## Integration Points

### Webex API
- Device Management endpoints
- User Management endpoints
- Workspace Configuration endpoints
- Call and Meeting endpoints

### File System
- CSV files for batch input/output
- Configuration files
- Logging outputs

## Testing Approach
- Manual testing of scripts against test environments
- Validation of API responses
- Error case testing

## Deployment and Distribution
- Scripts can be run directly from the repository
- No compilation or build process required
- Can be packaged for distribution if needed

This technical context document provides an overview of the technologies, dependencies, and technical considerations that shape the WebexTools project. It serves as a reference for understanding the technical foundation of the system.

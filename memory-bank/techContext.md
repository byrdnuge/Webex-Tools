# Technical Context: WebexTools

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Poetry**: Dependency management and packaging
- **Rich-click**: Enhanced CLI interface with rich formatting
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **Requests Library**: For HTTP interactions with the Webex API
- **CSV Module**: For processing batch operations
- **Environment Variables**: For configuration and secrets management

### External Dependencies
- **Cisco Webex API**: The primary external service this toolkit interacts with
- **Python Requirements**:
  - rich-click: Enhanced CLI interface with rich formatting
  - pydantic: Data validation and settings management
  - requests: HTTP client for API interactions
  - python-dotenv: Environment variable management
  - rich: Terminal formatting and display
  - typer: (Alternative to rich-click, to be evaluated)
  - Other dependencies as managed by Poetry

## Development Environment

### Setup Requirements
1. Python 3.8+ installed
2. Poetry installed for dependency management
3. Webex API credentials (tokens)
4. .env file configured with necessary credentials

### Configuration
The project uses multiple configuration approaches:
1. **Poetry Configuration**: `pyproject.toml` for project metadata and dependencies
2. **Environment Variables**: `.env` file for secrets and API tokens
3. **User Configuration**: Optional config file for persistent user settings

A `.env.example` file is provided as a template for the required environment variables:
- WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN: Authentication token for Webex API
- Other API-specific configuration variables

## Technical Constraints

### API Limitations
- Webex API rate limits must be respected
- Authentication tokens have expiration periods
- Some operations require specific permissions or roles

### Security Considerations
- API tokens must be kept secure
- Sensitive data should not be hardcoded or committed to repositories
- CSV files may contain sensitive information and should be handled accordingly
- User configuration files need appropriate permissions

### Performance Factors
- Batch operations should implement appropriate pacing to avoid rate limiting
- Large datasets may require pagination or chunking
- Error handling should be robust to avoid partial completion issues
- CLI responsiveness is important for user experience

## Integration Points

### Webex API
- Device Management endpoints
- User Management endpoints
- Workspace Configuration endpoints
- Call and Meeting endpoints
- Legal Hold data (future)

### File System
- CSV files for batch input/output
- Configuration files
- Logging outputs
- HTML report generation (for legal hold data)

## Testing Approach
- Unit testing with pytest
- Integration testing against test environments
- Validation of API responses
- Error case testing
- CLI interface testing

## Deployment and Distribution
- Packaged as a Python package using Poetry
- Installable via pip from PyPI (future)
- Executable CLI command after installation
- Potential for containerized deployment

This technical context document provides an overview of the technologies, dependencies, and technical considerations that shape the WebexTools project. It serves as a reference for understanding the technical foundation of the system.

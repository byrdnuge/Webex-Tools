# Project Brief: WebexTools

## Overview
WebexTools is a collection of Python utilities and scripts designed to simplify and automate interactions with the Cisco Webex API, with a particular focus on device management operations. The toolkit aims to provide administrators and developers with efficient ways to manage Webex devices, workspaces, and related resources.

## Core Objectives
- Simplify common Webex device management tasks through automation
- Provide reusable utilities for Webex API interactions
- Enable batch operations for device management
- Reduce manual effort required for Webex administration

## Target Users
- Webex administrators
- IT operations teams
- Developers building on the Webex platform
- Organizations with multiple Webex devices to manage

## Key Features
- Device activation and provisioning
- Workspace management
- User and number lookup functionality
- Batch operations via CSV processing
- Flexible device creation (meeting rooms, flex devices)

## Success Criteria
- Reduced time spent on manual Webex device management
- Consistent and error-free device provisioning
- Ability to scale device management operations
- Clear documentation and easy-to-use interfaces

## Constraints
- Must adhere to Webex API limitations and best practices
- Should be usable by administrators with minimal Python knowledge
- Must handle authentication and security appropriately

## Timeline
- Initial development: Completed
- Current phase: Ongoing maintenance and feature additions

This brief serves as the foundation for all other memory bank documents and will be updated as the project evolves.
